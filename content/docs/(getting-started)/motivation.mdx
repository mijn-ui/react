description: We have always admired the ShadCN UI components for their elegance and functionality. However, as we integrated ShadCN into our projects, we encountered some challenges that led us to develop our own solution.

### Limitations of ShadCN UI

- **Limited Variant Options**: ShadCN UI does not offer a wide variety of variants, which can restrict design flexibility.
- **Styled/Unstyled Options**: ShadCN UI requires using Radix components to create unstyled versions. This can be cumbersome, especially for complex components like dialogs. It often necessitates rewriting components or dealing with messy class overrides.
- **Missing Components**: ShadCN UI lacks components like full calendars, multi-selects, and icon-ready input fields.

### Why We Created Mijn-UI

To address these challenges, we developed Mijn-UI with the following goals:

- **Styled and Unstyled Variants**: Provide both styled and unstyled options, giving developers more control over their designs.
- **Extensive Variant Options**: Offer a wide range of variants to seamlessly integrate with different design systems.
- **Additional Components**: Include components like calendars, multi-selects, and icon-ready input fields to enhance the library's functionality.
- **Easy Integration**: Package Mijn-UI as an npm module for easy installation and maintenance, ensuring a streamlined development experience.

With Mijn-UI, we aim to offer a versatile and flexible component library that addresses the limitations we encountered, while maintaining ease of use and integration for developers.
